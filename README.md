# Hospital-Management-Software
This was my first attempt at PHP back in 2009 - it looks very embarrassing now. However, I built a HMS with PHP from scratch.
It is a full-fledged Hospital Management System (ERP) to automate IN and OUT patient management, Drug (pharmacy) and inventory management, Hospital financials and Queue management. The application was developed using PHP, MySQL, Javascript, and Ajax
It would be great to see this developed further; OOP, Laravel? Its totally free, complete with real database of patients and drugs!
